            <h3>Where we stand and where we'll go.</h3>
            <p>Our goal is to build fully automatic greenhouses for everyone.<br>
            We want them to be both affordable and comprehensive, we want to enable you to grow your own organic food anywhere.<br><br>
          	Currently we are at the very beginning of our journey and we are rennovating the greenhouse that will be our first fully automized prototype that also serves as the natural habitat of SpiderPi.<br><br>

                <h5>Mini Greenhouses</h5>
                <p>These Mini Greenhouses have a built in mechanism that manipulates the day-lenght to your plants needs.<br><br>
                    The curtains close and the light comes up based on data transmitted by sensors and a program that knows plants exact light needs that can apply them and improve the data.<br>
