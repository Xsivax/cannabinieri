            <h3>Built and play.</h3>
            <p>Puzzle together your greenhouse with our out of the box modules or check out our tutorials, get a Pi and do it yourself.<br>
            Those greenhouses don't spy on you and you can repair and program them yourself. While experimenting both you and them learn.<br><br>
              They are so awesome, they record how your plants are doing and then act itelligently acording to their needs.<br>
              Sweet sweet nothing still but we are developing the first modules.

                <p>This module consists of a humidity sensor, a water pump and a tube.<br><br>
                   Water is given based on your plants specific needs.<br>
