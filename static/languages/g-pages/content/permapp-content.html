            <h3> Let's create a database of our ecosystem!</h3>
            <p>Our PerMapp is an app that stores all the connections in our ecosystem.<br>
            Everything around us is connected, every plant affects all other plants and animals and in the end us people.<br>
          In order to keep utilizing our planets ressources, we need to understand the complex system that definines life and decay .
          Add relations you found out about, keep experimenting with the ones that are already known, so in the end we got the data neccessary for a sustainable and automated future of farming.<br><br>
