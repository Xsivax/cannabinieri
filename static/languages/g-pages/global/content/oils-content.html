        <p>This is the first product page. It's a summary what our oils are about. Here we will introduce our first product the 10% Oil "Sauvage". We will add pictures, a short description of the product and some background information. For more information we refer to our contacts page. We also add a link to the product page, that is also refered to on the QR code on the product. There are also links to our social media.
            We need to also link legal information and if present related blog-posts, we should also refer to our "Partners" page where a description of Tommaso's CBD can be found. We need to add a statement why this is our first experiement, we need to add what makes it special and what benefits customers have compared to similar products. All links appear within text.

            <h6> Sauvage - The Wild One</h6>
            <p>She is our first experiment,<br>Grown outdoors all summer she fought pests storms and drought <br>all herself without any use of pesticides*.<br>
                She didn't get much help from plants other than herself neither from spiders.
                She is our first experiment in terms of full-spectrum oil production and the analysis of factors that influenced her growth, taste and look.
                <br> <br> With 14 % CBD and less than 0.2 % THC this sativa strain <br>native to switzerland is your girl for heavy relaxation.
