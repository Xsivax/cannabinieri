            WE set ourselves the goal of understanding our plants and the whole ecosystem that surrounds them ; <br>
            in order to optimize our Experiments we will apply what we learned from nature.<br>
            We aim to collect data about all entities that influence a plants health ;<br>
            we explore environmental factors & relations between plants and animals ; <br>
            collected data is utilized to improve and alter our Experiments.<br>
            We believe that biodynamic agriculture can and should be automized; <br>
            and made accessible to everyone;<br>
            we want people to be able to grow their own food and herb ;<br>
            even if their shedule does not allow them having a traditional garden;<br>
            for that we will create SpiderPi.<br>
            That robot - currently in developement will know how to interact with plants<br>
             in our ecosystem and <br>
            grow local organic food for everyone.<br>
            The Cannabis Plant -<br>
            with its numerous Effects all depending on Plant-Components is<br>
            SpiderPi's best partner.<br> There is a lot to DISCOVER

            <p class="details">Rocky soil is crucial for plants in dry areas where there can't be found a lot of dead organic matter in the soil.<br> 
              Without the stones in the soil that contain a high concentration of phosperus plant growth would be on hold.<br>
              With the help of mykhorizza within the soil the plants roots wrap themselves around rocks in the soil and suck out all the phosperus in order to grow.<br>
            In humid areas the high concentrarion of phosperus enables a cycle of heavy plant growth where plants absorb the phosperus out of the soil and then drop dead organic plant matter with hight concentrations of phosperus that in turn can be sbaorbed by them along with the phosperus out of the stones.

             <h3 class="micro">Phosphorus</h3>
             <p class="tiny">Phosphorus is a vital nutrient for all plants. Plants require this nutrient in order to grow.<br>
              Phosphorus helps to stimulate root development, increase the strength of stems and and seed production. <br>
              The plant can use this strength to pump all its energy into the production of crops. <br>
              A high concentration of phosphorus naturally also improves a plants resistance against disseases and pests.<br>
              <br> 
              A exessive concentration of phospherus within the soil keeps a plant from absorbing other micronutrients, particulary iron and zinc which are also vital for a plants survival.<br>
              Too much phosperus within a plant and within the soil around it leads to the high concentration of phospherus getting transmitted into waters which react leads to exessive growth of algae that in turn impact the water quality because it decreases the available space for other aquatic plants and therefore fish that depend on them.<br>
              <br><br>
              Plants need phosphorus for the developement of roots and the growth of their stems, leaves and fruit. <br>
              For the Cannabis plant a high concentration of phospherus is benefitial in all stages.<br>
              With phospherus they are able to form stronger roots, more robust stems, increase their growth as well as the formation of flowers while being resistant against disseases. <br>
              Phospherus is dominant in sandy and rocky soil that is often found along the coastline and in dry areas with a desert climate.<br>

            Sauvage was only influenced by natural light conditions, light conditions were not manipulated.<br>
            She grew in the mediteranen coast climate of northern italy. She was sewn in spring and harvested in september,<br>
            her natural life-cycle was 6 months. She started to flower after 3 months in the vegetative stage and kept flowering for 2,5 months until harvest.<br>
            These sun conditions mean XX and XX within it has XX effects on plants growth and health.

            <h3 class="type">Temperature</h3>
            <p class="details">Temperatures in the Mediteranean climate ecosystem along the westcoast of italy are largely defined by the interaction of its landmasses and the sea.<br> 
              The sea is responsible for its dry and hot summers and rainy mild winters.<br>
              Summers are hot with clear skies that bring many hours of bright sun while rainy winter wet the soil to give life to new plants.
              Temperatures range between X and X.
              <br>
              Since the sea highly influenced by winds than continental areas more extreme weather conditions are present.

             <h3 class="micro">Cycle</h3>
             <p class="tiny">The climate zone and its following sun hours define the different life stages of a plant.<br>
               In order to root plants require a destinct temperature and minimal hours of sunlight or in general light.<br>
              In the mediteranean climate zone the conditions allow mny plants to grow yearlong since it never freezes. <br>
              Other plants such as the Cannabis plant require more light than what is given by nature to grow yearlong.<br>
              Seasons which once again depend on the sun and the sea in this climate zone define when seeds are able to sprout.<br>
              <br> 
              For that they demand a minimal soil temperature of 21 degrees celcius which outdoors is only given when clouds and rain dissappear and make place for everlasting sun that warms the soil. <br>
              The seeds of Sauvage were sown into the heated ground and were set on their natural cycle of 3 months of upward growth and following 3 months of flowering.<br>
              <br><br>
              Up to X sun hours daily and barely clouds supplied the plants with ascending sun hours and therefore, in form of light and warmth, with the power to perform their photosysnthesis.  <br>
              The plants grow upwards as long as the days become longer and the sunlight increases, when the days begin to become shorter the plants start developing their flowers until the light and warmth is no longer enough to supply them with the warmth and light they need.<br>
              In September ? the days begin to become shorter and the plants flower as long as the soil temperature enables them to do so. <br>
             All plants rely on the ammount of sun hours, the more sun they get the better they grow as long as the neccessary ammount of moisture is given as well.<br>
             Depending on the yearly changes of sun hours and corresponding changes of temperature along with the changes of wind and the relation of sun water and wind all plants start their cycle of growth fruit or flower and decay.
             In the mediteranean area the best growth conditions are given and a huge biodiversity can exist and relate to each other.

            Sauvage was watered by fresh river water without any supplements.<br>
           The river flows through the mountains and water is captured in so called Vascas, big stone cans that capture water and lead its through tubes, that lead the water downwards.<br>
            At the fields where she was grown all the water was taken from the vascas.<br>
             The river water is a top carrier of nutrients, through it's fast stream downwards it pulls along surrounding soil, stones , sand and dead plant material.<br>
             The plant material contains nutrients that serve as food for bacteria and insects that in turn serve as food for fish that leaves fecal matter and serves as food for mammals.<br>

            <p class="details">#To be edited !! #Info about how aquaducts are built #where water comes from(lake) Sauvage was solely fed by the water of a river floating through mountains of a forrest , the river gets fed by rain-water and enriched by surrounding plant and animal material.<br> 
             The forrest is at most places untouched and floats widely through the mountains serving as a habitat for biodiverse species and as a water supply for the surrounding fields and households.<br>
              The water that through its natural flow flows down the mountain is led down by tubes that lead to tons out of stone on different heights.
              From each of these Vascas tubes lead down to surrounding fields and one of them served Sauvage as a water supply.
              <br>
              Through the river-water many nutrients that the river moved all the way from the top of the mountain down to the supply fed the soil Sauvage's roots fed on.
              Nutrients that went along the water flow were all the necessary for aplant growth such as nitrogen, phosphorus,calcium, potassium and kalium.<br>
              Nitrogen is an element that is essential for a plants growth and it exists naturally both in the athmospere and the water.

               It is also a vital element for a plants growth because it is a source of proteins for them.<br>
              Nitrogen found in the athmosphere and in the soil however can't be used by plants, it ha to be transformed into through water absorbable Nitrogen Kations. <br>
              The transformation is done by bacteria present in healthy soil and water.<br>
              Plants then absorb the Kations and in turn transform them into proteins necessary for the formation of strong roots and stalks amd therefore in the vegetative stage.
              <br>
              <br> 
              However a high concentration of Nitrogen can eventually create a lot of harm especially in the water that is both a media for the creation of itrogen as well as a carrier of it. <br>
              By the exessive use of Nitrogen-Fertilizers the natural Nitrogen-Cycle is no longer able to function in a benefitial way for organisms<br>
              <br><br>
              And Fish die of a lack of oxygen.<br>
              This can be stopped by supporting the natural nitrogen cycle and understanding it.
              A nitrogen cycle can be easily created whereever water and healthy living and eventually decaying organisms exist.

            Sauvage grew up in normal air conditions.<br>
           Surrounded by mountains and small villages she was not influenced by man made Co2 or other greenhouse gases<br>
            The surface air temperature was highly dependent on the weather - the humidity as well as the temperatures varied with the changes of weather.<br>
            Also air temperature as well as changes in weather vary over the years by the impact of greenhosuse gases released into the air.<br>
            The one greenhouse gas that is directly related and in interaction with all plants is Co2 which plants breath in and then breath over their leaves as HO2.<br>

            <h3 class="type">Humidity</h3>
            <p class="details">Sauvage was through her whole life-cycle exposed to varying ammounts of humidity.<br> 
             In the Medireranean Climate the humidity of the air goes along perfectly with the cannabis plants natural life-cycle.<br>
              When she was sewn the soil held a high ammount of water which had to do with the frequent rainfalls appearing in spring on the italian coast that watered the soil and by that produced a high humidity in the air around.<br>
              Frequent rainfalls make up the perfect environment for seedlings to grow.<br>
              Fresh seedlings keep by default their stomata, through which they breath, closed to prevent any loss of the water absorbed by their roots in early stages where they are still fragile.<br>
              <br>
              A high humidity in the growing environment encourages them to open their stomata and by that breathe the surrounding Co2 and release it as H2o.<br>
              A high humidity in the early stages increases the plants ability to do photosynthesis and by that grow.<br>
              As plants grow older and more stable they require the opposite of a moist environment, since now they have developed a lot of roots and upward-growth that need to be fed.<br>
              Plants need to be able to perform photosynthesis to a high ammount by opening their stomata requently.<br>
              If the air is too humid plants cant't release the H02 into the air since the air (exp.why !). <br>
              The italian coast climate brings perfect air conditions for plants to grow, to breathe CO2 in the athmosphere and release Ho2.

             <p class="tiny">The cultivation of plants helps with slowing down global warming, especially if their cultivation does not require burning of fossil fuels and is done without producing waste and burning dead plant material.<br>
               Sauvage has been cultivated in a fashion that is benefitial for slowing down global warming.<br>
              In the recent years the surface temperature on our planet has increased tremendously through the burning of fossil fuels, the burning of trash, the burning down of forrests and the existance of huge animal farms. <br>
              The greenhouse gases treathen teh health of animals and plants and the resulting global warming confuses all environmental forces..<br>
              While human-made gases such as methane and sulfur dioxide threaten plants in many ways(...) they instead benefit from a high concentration of Co2 in the air and are by that a means of the reduction of the gas and the slowing down of global warming.
              <br>
              <br> 
              Plants need CO2 to breathe while they release HO2 which cools down the earth surface and by that works against global warming. <br>
              Since they also set free o2 into the athmosphere they are a vital part of the creation of life of both humen and animals, as long as new clean air is created life will continue and disseases will be increased.<br>
              <br><br>
              In order to control global warming and by that the continuance of organic agriculture is necessary.<br>
              Sauvage grew up in a healthy environment for herself and the environment while taking part in the creation of a planet that supports life.<br>
              In order to slow down the speed of global warming and by that the dying of many species and eventually the complete transformation of our planet one can start with growing a plant and in the process not make us of fossil fuels.<br>

            <h3 class="type">Boytritis</h3>
            <p class="details">50% of this years yield have been infected by the fungus boytritis.<br> 
             It is one of the most common fungi present in soil of a high humidity.<br>
             This fungus first infects a plants roots and then works its way up over the stems.<br>
              First the stems get coated by a fluffy white coat that infects the youngest stems, at the bottom of the plant, first and turns them soft and brown , the fungus keeps spreading upwards and finally infects the plants leaves which first turn yellow and finally brown and wilt completely.<br>
              This fungus can in early stages be identified by stems that become soft and change their color to brown and then finally damp off.<br>
              In later stages it shows itself as a furry brown or grey coating over leaves and fruit - in this stage the spores have already developed and gotten spread by air ventilation.<br>
              <br>
              This fungus is a common one in Marijuana plants and it has the force to destroy complete yields, once it was developed in the soil it is usually already to late to save the infected plants.<br>
              In a field where plants grow up close to each other the spores spread rapidly above ground as the fungus grows in the soil.<br>
              To minimize the impact the fungus has, a broader spacing between plants as well as the use of planting bags for each individual plant is one approach - next to these measures as a long-term solution one has to prevent the fungus from spreading both in soil and in air.<br>
              <br>
              Luckily there are organic solutions to get rid of this enemy of all plants.<br>
              The best solution, since the fungus is present within the soil is to treat the soil another more temporary one are foliar sprays that add beneficial bacteria that help the plants fighting the fungus.<br>
              It is important to know that this sort of fungus dislikes high temperatures and will die at XXdegrees, and also in XXacidity.<br>
              A treatment of soil must include two approaches one being to control the humidity and acidity of the soil by choosing a soil type and the second is the cultivation of mychorizzal bacteria that help plants roots to establish an immunity against fungal thread. <br>
              Benefitial bacteria are those that are responsible for the compostation of organic material.<br>
              In order to let them fight for you all that has to be made is a compost pile where dead plants as well as organic leftover foods go.<br>

             <h3 class="micro">Compost</h3>
             <p class="tiny">.<br>
               On Sauvage no compost bacteria was explicitely used.<br>
                A great oppurtunity to make the plants more resistant against dangerous fungi and bacteria and also to increase their health has been missed.<br>
                Also there has been made no use of the benefits of Permaculture fields which are closely related to the process of compostation and therefore relations between plants bacteria and fungi.<br>
                Even though Sauvage herself has fought the fungal thread - this can only be related to the good soil quality since no inorganic fertilizers have been used.<br>
                #what did Tommaso actually do aginst it ? 
              <br>
              <br> 
              The soil is one of the most unexplored entities on our planet even though it holds the potential to immensly increase both the quality and quantity of all our crops. <br>
              The soil holds the potential to fight pests, fungi and disseases as well as increase yields without any need for the use of more land, more water or any inorganic fertilizers.<br>
              <br><br>
              Responsible for all interactions between plants and soil are bacteria and fungi which are living within the soil.<br>
              There are both dangerous and beneficial bacteria and fungi for different plants, grey mold is not just bad but also serves as a sweetener for grapes.<br>
              Boytritis does in fact only infect plants that don't have the help of beneficial soil bacteria and mychorizzal fungi that help them with their intake of nutrients and protect their roots against destructive fungi. <br>
              <br><br>
              Notable in the fight against Boytritis are for once the bacteria which are responsible for the compostation of plant and organic material.<br>
              Those bacteria eat up solid material and turn it into soil that includes all the nutrients that have been present in the compostated material.<br>
              In the form of soil the material serves as the home of a plants roots where it can get the nutrients that help it with its growth and strenght.<br>
              Healthy soil which includes a lot of nutrients also serves as a home for beneficial bacteria such as pseudomonas and mychorizzal fungi which help the plant grow while in turn they benefit from it.<br>
              Those bacteria and fungi serve two causes for the plant: first they make nutrients within the soil usable for the plant and second they protect its roots either from the inside or outside.<br>
              <br>
              The help of beneficial bacteria can be used and by that also explored by creating a Permaculture field where dead plant material and also peels of fruit etc are left to compose and are then in turn added to the soil where new strong growth is desired.<br>
              There are many different ways of compostation, to learn more visit our <a href="../blog.html">Blog</a>.

            #human as controlling entity between plants and environment #sows #cares #produces #consumes.<br>
            Sauvage ,such as every plant, has a complex relationship to us humans, since we interacted with the environment in order to precicely create her.<br>
            People decide which crop to grow, where ro grow it, in which quantity to grow it, how to help it growing and to protect it from disseases and then when to harvest, how to process and finally how to utilize - utilization meaning either for personal use to sell in order to create a use for others.<br>
            Since the rise of humanity people have a evolving relationship with plants.<br>
            At the very beginning people only utilized what was given to them, they collected crops that grew naturally in the environment where they decided to settle - in fact if people searched for a place to settle they choose the ones that provided the highest quantity and quality of food sources.<br>
            Then as people evolved they began to understand how to give life to plants when they need them, they explored how to sow plants and how to harvest and store them.
            <br>
            Plants for the indigenous people served as a source of life, of nutrients, of power and to be capable of the cultivation of plants was a means of status and the initialization of the creation of larger settlements that were able to establish a continous crop production and by that had time to work on the creation of cities which could evolve since the problem of food was solved.<br>
            Therefore plants like corn were worshipped, they were all source of life and their cultivation finally enabled innovation.<br>
            As time went on people began building large settlements that were connected by railroads, which in turn served as a means for the transportation and trade of traditional crops<br>
            Like that the corn that has been discovered by indigenous people and as their small settlements evolved to cities , was still worshipped and all culture was build around the crop, and at a certain point they started trade and their crop made its way into other cultures.<br>
            Like this the demand of the crop rose and the traditional methods of cultivation were no longer enough, there were competitors all over the word trying to cultivate a higher quantity of a crop.<br>
            Scientists effectively established products to increase the yield and spent little time thinking about what they do to the environment, the plants and finally people.<br>
            Monoculture led to to an exhaustio of the soil, the transport led to high emissions, the cultivation in unlikely places led to an exhaustion of water supplies, ferilizers and pesticides poisoned the soil(?) and the burning down of rainforrests and transformation of rich ecosystems into monocultural farmlands takes many species natural habitat and decreases the biodiversity that is necessary for healthy ecosystems.<br>
            Since these circumstances were man made and the relationship between plants and people is an ever changing one, man can decide how he cultivated crops, where and to which ammount, he can decide where he wants to ship them and man can make these decision together with nature.
            We can decide to work with nature and understand in order to sustainably increase the quality and quantity of our yields at the same time. <br><br>
            Sauvage has been grown in an environment where all her needs are satisfied by nature but in order to boost what nature gives we can understand and utilize the power of other plants and the power of bacteria and fungi.<br>
            All our actions a a human have effects on plants and we should be concious of that and not take food and also Cannabis for granted because if we destroy or not rehabilitate necessary relations of a plant it can't persist.<br>
            <br>We humans have in most fields developed machines that help us capture issues and then help us solve them while we can concentrate on which issue to solve next.<br>
            We have created machines that are able to learn and work for us and there is a lot to be learned about our ecosystem and a lot of physical work to do that can be done by machines while people can work on the reasearch and solution of the next problem.<br>
            <br><br>
            Factors of importance concerning the plant-human relationship in the creation of Sauvage are : The sowing, the water-supply, the pest and dissease management, the measures to improve plant health,
           the harvest and the extraction of the CBD oil ,our trading-decisions and our use of technology that represents us in relation to the plants.<br>

            <p class="details">In order for Sauvage to survive our partner <a href="../partners.html">Thommaso</a> had to care for her.<br> 
              #assumptions.<br>
              At first there had been the decision that he wants to cultivate legal Cannabis plants, that contain a high concentration of the cannabinoid CBD and a low concentration of the cannabinoid THC .<br>
              This decision has been made for once because of his relationship with the plant Cannabis, because he himself enjoys consuming it, and also because of his knowledge about the fertility of the land surrounding him.<br>
              Next, with that decision being made he needed to decide which field to choose for his project and which seeds he wants to choose - he needed to find a plant that requires his needs and also the environments needs.<br>
              He choose seeds from Switzerland because (?) he knew about that country being one of the most advanced on the CBD market and by that offer many varieties of seeds to choose from .<br>
              <br>
              Now he needed to choose a field for his project.<br>
               Him living in Perinaldo, a tiny italian town, high up the mountains and surrounded by untouched nature, he decided to buy a field in #exact location.<br>
               The decision was made because of the water supply available on the field, it was provided with the water from an Aqueduct that leads the water from #name of lake, all the way through the mountains to his field.<br>
              Once he managed to get the land the water and the seeds, he was all set to start growing.<br>
              He needed to take care of the timing now, the decision when to grow and when to harvest needed to be made.<br>
              <br>
              For that he needed to analyze the local environmental entities that define the growing conditions and the plants behaviour according to them.<br>
              He knew that Cannabis seeds will only germinate if the soil temperature is above 21 degrees and a high humidity is given as well as enough sunlight.<br>
              Now he needed to find the right time to sow, so he needed to anylyze the soil temperature and soil humidity as well as keep a track on the hours of sunlight - by that he found the perfect time in April(?).
            <br>
              He planted XX plants on XX space with a distance of XX.<br>
              Then he needed to decide how often to water the plants and wether to fertilize them and how. <br>
              He began a watering routine of XXday / a day, he drove to the field and checked on the plants wether they grow as expected or not.<br>
              <br>
              He decided to <a href="../blog.html">top</a> the plants regularily to increase the yield.<br>
              <br>
              The plants germinated and grew for 3 months until the plants reached a height in a range from 30cm to 1.5m.<br>
              By the natural cycle Cannabis plants start flowering when the longest day of the year has passed which is June 21 - from that date on the sun hours drop below 12 hours until they ascend again startting from December 21.<br>
              Thommaso now needed to decide how long he wants the plants develope flower in order to achieve the highest yields.<br>
              Flowers were fully developed after 10 weeks. Thommaso controlled them regularily to pick the <a href="../blog.html">right time to harvest</a>.<br>
              At the beginning of September time to harvest came. <br>
              #mention harvest method & methods of drying and storing + shorten text above !
              #mention we helped with the harvest
              #mention how he sold the most part of the yield, sold as what ? processed?

             <p class="tiny">.<br>
                We saw our opportunity to produce our first oil, a prototype, even though our own project was just started in June this year.<br>
                We knew, by helping with the harvest about the plants and how they have been grown and decided to use them for our first Experiment : The CBD oil Sauvage.<br>
                <br>
                We believe it is a good place to start anylyses with a product that was grown locally within the natural soil of this place and under the natural environmental conditions .<br>
                <br>
                Here we wanted to start our exploration of the different methods of CBD oil extraction.
              <br>
              <br> 
              For our first Experiment we choose the alcohol-extraction method.<br>
              Our aim here was to use only resaurces that we had available and only methods that can be easily immitated and are 100% organic.<br>
              <br><br>
              We grinded the flowers, then we left them in a bath of alcohol that was used as a solvent to extract the essential CBD oil out of the flowers .<br>
              We left the CBD inside that tincture for 24 hours, then we parted the flowers from the alcohol that held their essence with all their therapeutic components.<br>
              After that we slowly warmed up the fluid mixture of alcohol and full-spectrum CBD oil. <br>
              <br><br>
              In order for all to be present we took care that the water never extended the temperature of 60 degrees celcius where the first cannabinois evaporate.<br>
              TWe cooked the mixture until all the alcohol had evaporated which took 4 hours of cooking.<br>
              What was left was 12 grams of pure CBD essential oil.<br>

              Thommaso now needed to decide how long he wants the plants develope flower in order to achieve the highest yields.<br>
              Flowers were fully developed after 10 weeks. Thommaso controlled them regularily to pick the <a href="../blog.html">right time to harvest</a>.<br>
              At the beginning of September time to harvest came. <br>
              #mention harvest method & methods of drying and storing + shorten text above !
              #mention we helped with the harvest
              #mention how he sold the most part of the yield, sold as what ? processed?

                We saw our opportunity to produce our first oil, a prototype, even though our own project was just started in June this year.<br>
                We knew, by helping with the harvest about the plants and how they have been grown and decided to use them for our first Experiment : The CBD oil Sauvage.<br>
                <br>
                We believe it is a good place to start anylyses with a product that was grown locally within the natural soil of this place and under the natural environmental conditions .<br>
                <br>
                Here we wanted to start our exploration of the different methods of CBD oil extraction.
              <br>
              <br> 
              For our first Experiment we choose the alcohol-extraction method.<br>
              Our aim here was to use only resaurces that we had available and only methods that can be easily immitated and are 100% organic.<br>
              <br><br>
              We grinded the flowers, then we left them in a bath of alcohol that was used as a solvent to extract the essential CBD oil out of the flowers .<br>
              We left the CBD inside that tincture for 24 hours, then we parted the flowers from the alcohol that held their essence with all their therapeutic components.<br>
              After that we slowly warmed up the fluid mixture of alcohol and full-spectrum CBD oil. <br>
              <br><br>
              In order for all to be present we took care that the water never extended the temperature of 60 degrees celcius where the first cannabinois evaporate.<br>
              TWe cooked the mixture until all the alcohol had evaporated which took 4 hours of cooking.<br>
              What was left was 12 grams of pure CBD essential oil.<br>
