<h1>Perma Culture</h1>
		<p> A short description of the background of our use of Permaculture plus examples, also some pictures and links to all relevant topics like i.e a blogpost about our use of aloe vera. Here we describe why we decided to grow  our crops in an environment of permaculture rathr than in ond of monoculture, which benefits there are and what we can learn and explore there. here goes also a statement to our stand to monoculture and why we believe that it should be abolished completely. Some text about our scientific interest in relations between plants and our stand on Cannabis as on entity in a huge system. Also what results are expected by our experiments with Permaculture, both for the consumer and and for our own research. For the consumer we need to define our goals concerning taste, transparency, organic cultivation, health benefits, they need to be used wit the *, we can't forget about that.
