            <h3>We want you to automate yourself !</h3>
            <p>Currently many tasks that used to be done by people are done by computers.<br>
             In agriculture there are  many interesting projects going on that will soon replace farmworkers with software-engineers.<br><br>
              Automation is an amazing opportunity to get tasks done more efficiently and to collect data in order to get a better understanding on how things work.<br><br>
              Even though there are many people loosing their jobs while not being able to find a new job with their skillset that used to be valuable.<br><br>
               So we want everyone to get aquainted with automation, in order to keep working and keep contributing to the progress.<br><br>
              For that it is important to start small automation projects yourself that are fun, that make you learn and of which you profit.<br><br>
