				<p class="text">We are currently a collective of 5 people, determined to connect science to agriculture and specifically the Cannabis plant.<br><br>
                                Our lab is located on the italian westcoast and that is where our plants and ideas grow.<br><br>
									   The main engine of this project is obtaining information about our plants relations and to share those with our customers.<br><br>
									   We are cultivating and processing our plants ourselves.<br>
                                   Our products are 100% organic grab-bags of information.</p>
