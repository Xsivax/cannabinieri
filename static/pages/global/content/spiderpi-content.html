               <h3>About a Spider</h3>
               <p>SpiderPi is our garden hexapod, he is aimed to be a garden helper and a walking database of our ecosystem.<br>
                     Through object detection he will recognize what is happening around him and check a plant for pests and disseases and then execute measures of biodynamic pest- and dissease management.<br><br>
                     Currently SpiderPi is learning to walk on uneven ground and recognize his surroundings in order to operate within them.<br><br>

                   <p>Our first challenge is to let SpiderPi detect his surroundings and navigate through them.<br><br>
                      We replaced his built in camera with a 360 and wrote an object detection program that enables him to navigate through his surroundings and respond to obstacles.<br>
                       We used the software X, camera X, sensors X, made X changes on the Spider.<br><br>
