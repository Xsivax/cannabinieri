                        All those principles are about a optimized use of our limited ressources while creating a sustaining value - a self-sufficient system that takes care of itself. <br>

                        In order to build such a system a lot of information is required and this information is gained with tech, <br> to ultimately reach the goal of an actual automatic garden that takes care of itself by the rules of nature.<br> This can be a longer text. It should include all info we want to share about no waste, renewable energy, fish, herbs and our experiments.<br> When we got the demeter seal we can also mention it here or that we are working on obtaining it now.<br>
                         This text is about what permaculture is, why it is useful, why and how we use it and how the definition can include robots, maybe no robots here and just what people need to know about us not using plastic, creating a biodynamic farm, working on renewable energy solutions and utilizing partnerplants for our experiments.<br>
