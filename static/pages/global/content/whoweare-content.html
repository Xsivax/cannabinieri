              <h3><span>We grow our future</h3>
              <p>We are working actively on creating a future that is reigned by knowledge about our environment .<br>
             It is a future that enables us to make use of the full potential of our planet and grow our crops by the principles of nature and with the help of modern technology.<br>
            We want our projects and products to be seen as packages of knowledge - as an ability to understand how complex and exiting the system around us is.<br>
             Our goal is to understand our ecosystem and the influence of every relation on a product. We want you to know all we know.<br><br>
             Collective knowledge, heath and excitement about our environment empowers us to grow further.<br><br>

                  <h3>Working with Nature</h3>
                  <p>We want to utilize all of natures powers and explore organic and biodynamic solutions for pest and dissease management. By that we aim to obtain the highest quality and quantity of yields by only playing with natures entities.<br>
                 We are currently aspiring to obtain the Demeteter label which proves that all principlels of biodynamic agriculture are approved .<br>
                We want to build a self-sufficient system where each plant and each environmental factor profit from each other.
                All products we use on our plants are products made out of our plants.<br><br>

                  <h3>Exploring the full potential of CBD</h3>
                  <p>The Cannabis plant consisists of more than 120 different cannabinoids which all affect our body and psyche in unique ways.<br>
                All our experiments are tailored to create exquisit compositions of different tastes and effects, just by manipulating environmental factors and the use of partnerplants.<br>
                We evaluate the results through advanced technology lab tests, that precicely determine the quantity of different cannabinoids in our experiments. 
                By lab testing we also find out more about pests and disseases affecting our plants.Through constant reasearch and the collection of data we find organic solutions for their prevention.<br><br>
                We are experimenting with all available extraction methods and our products ship with a lab test.<br>

                  <h3>Automation for the People</h3>
                  <p>If we talk about automation we mean people automating gardening for themselves, not people being automated.<br>
                 One of the main engines of this project is to find affordable and comprehensible solutions that enable everyone to have their own organic automated garden everywhere.<br>
                We believe that many people utilizing our products, growing different plants under different conditions, enables us, all people, to create a huge net of data about our ecosystem that we can use and share and over which we have total control.
                We want everyone to have access to our projects that is why all of them are documented to be imitated and improved.<br><br>

                  <h3>Collective Growth</h3>
                  <p>We choose the business model of a collective for our project.<br>
                    We did start this business in X 2020, our idea was to start small in order not to have large expenses at the beginning, which enables us to make all or busines decisions ourselves.<br>
                 We want to have the total control over what we are doing and want to make collective decisions without an investor interfering and forcing us to compromise our values.
                 So our definition of growth is a slow but consitent growth, that lets us step by step realize each of our ideas.<br><br>
                 We want to share our data and every detail about what we are doing.<br>
                 We desire to know more, and so do you, so we are taking the first step by deciding to share all we do and doing it all ourselves.<br>
